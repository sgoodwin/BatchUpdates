# BatchUpdates
A demo for CoreData's batch update ability with explanations in the code.



There is a bunch of explanation in the code itself. Most of the party is happening in ```ViewController.swift```. Super informative name, right? Use better ones in your real code, this is a demo, so that's my excuse.
